* Game Story Syntax
** Configuration options
window size: is not specified then max widow side on the device.
other things: think about later.
** Nodes
First will be node number, which has to be unique integer.
Node number 0 is reserved for exit.
** Images
If image is to be change keep the image location inside <>.
** Story Text
Write the texts normally you can also have newline characters. But not in the action texts.
Any consecutive white spaces will be ignored. Feel free to use them to manage the story syntax.
** Dynamic Text/Variables
You can specify a number of dynamic texts and variables that the user can enter at the beginning of the game.
The names of the Texts/Variables needs to be all caps. 

It can be character's name, age, sex etc. For numerical values, you can assign a default values.
Anything not assigned a default value is considered to be not numerical.

You can have dynamic texts like character names and such. use them inside {}.
You can assign values, modify the numerical values and such in this. The evaluation result will be displayed in stead of the output, so if you want the evaluation but not to be output, end the expression with a semicolon.

# NOTE: looks like I'm going to have to write a calculator for this, maybe I should really go towards a full-fledged parser now.
** Delay
If you want delay between the texts insert number between [] like in the example below.
The unit for delay is in milliseconds.
You can also use this to show a series of multiple images.
** Choices
Write the node number it should go now inside ().
Write choices with () and text can have multiple paths available.
Whether it is single or multiple the user is asked to choose/continue.
** Ending lines
Newline character will end the node when there are already actions. If the newline is found before any actions then it is just considered part of the text and has no effect.

* Game Story Example Lines
1-<welcome-image.png>Open the game.[1000]choose action:(2)load history.(3)new game.(4)exit
4-Exiting...(0)Confirm exit.
3-Welcome.. May I know your name?{$PLAYER_NAME}(5)

* TODOs
** Make a parser for the game.
** Make a storyline checking program (for dangling endpoints).
** Make it generate compiled code from the story if possible.

* Future plans
- Add sound effects (parallel execution)
